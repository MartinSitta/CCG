As the first main target of this pre planned stage is to find out how I implement the creating of class diagramm elements via drag and drop,
Flow boxes are not particularily useful. However they might prove useful when making an overlay or a sidebar.
As only the core of the program is set in stone which is the making of class diagrams and none of the UI elements it still remains to be seen.
The main problem remains, which is: how in gods name can resize a box at will. this still remains to be quite confusing.
